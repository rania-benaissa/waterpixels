# waterpixels

A Python implementation of the Waterpixels segmentation algorithm based on the following research paper : [Waterpixels](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01212760/document). For further explanations, you can also refer to my [ project report (in french)](BENAISSA_Rania_Rapport_PIMA.pdf)


## Usage

The desktop application is built using `PyQT5`. Once you run the application file `application.py`, load the image to segment and adjust the parameters accordingly :

![Interface 1](/interface1.png)

You can then visualize the segmentation's results as follows : 

![Interface 2](/interface2.png)
